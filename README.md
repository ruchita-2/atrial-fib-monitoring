# Monitoring Atrial Fibrillation using ECG
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that evaluates the heart's electrical activity. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common type of heart arrhythmia associated with increased risks of stroke and heart failure. This project aims to develop a low-cost prototype that allows patients to constantly monitor their ECG and monitor AF. The prototype utilizes an Arduino UNO microcontroller and an AD8232 ECG sensor module. The prototype provides real-time ECG visualization on the serial plotter of the Arduino IDE.


## Objectives:
- To develop a prototype to assist people with heart conditions, particularly for monitoring atrial fibrillation.
- To create an affordable and cost-effective solution that simplifies AF monitoring for both patients and physicians.

## Components Used:
- Arduino UNO board
- AD8232 ECG sensor module

## Working Principle:
The device utilizes an Arduino UNO microcontroller connected to the AD8232 ECG Sensor. The electrodes are placed on the patient to measure the heart's electrical activity. The heart rate and heart rate variability are calculated, and the ECG waveforms can be viewed on the Serial Plotter of the Arduino. The sensor values, heart rate, and heart rate variability can be monitored on the Serial Monitor.
